Homework 10
Optimisation Team Game
Follow the instructions for the gas optimisation team game in the repo
https://github.com/ExtropyIO/ExpertSolidityBootcamp/tree/main/exercises/gas
Your team should try to reduce the amount of gas used to deploy the contract, and
when running transactions.
You can change the code as much as you like, but you must not change the tests, and
your contract must pass all tests.

-   Worked with team to get the run % down from 15.5% to 4.5%. Some groups were able
    to get it as low at 0.87%.
