Homework 12
Audit 1
Imagine you have been given the following code to audit
Contract
https://github.com/ExtropyIO/ExpertSolidityBootcamp/blob/main/exercises/audit/DogCoinGame.sol

with the following note from the team
"DogCoinGame is a game where players are added to the contract via the
addPlayer function, they need to send 1 ETH to play.
Once 200 players have entered, the UI will be notified by the startPayout event,
and will pick 100 winners which will be added to the winners array, the UI will then
call the payout function to pay each of the winners.
The remaining balance will be kept as profit for the developers."
Write out the main points that you would include in an audit report.
-   I did not modify the code, copy/pasted into src/
-   Notes
    line16: Default values in Solidity are in wei. Change that to 1e18.
    line20: StartPayout() gets emitted at 201st player, not 200th
    line29: Anyone can call payout(), consider adding restriction.
    line36: Anyone can call payWinners(), consider adding restriction.
    line36: Anyone can specify the amount of ETH they get sent from the contract.
    line30: Whoever calls payout is required to have 100 wei, odd restriction.
    line25: Anyone can add themselves as a winner. 

Underhanded Solidity
This contract is the winner of this years underhanded solidity contest, it mimics
the OpenSea application.

Can you spot the flaws in it
⛽🏌This is a gas-golfed version of Zora v3's Offers module!
🤩 A bidder can call createBid to bid on the NFT of their dreams.
💰 The NFT owner can call acceptBid to accept one of these on-chain bids.
🤝 Assets exchange hands.
😤 What could possibly go wrong?

Hints
Look at the Solmate contracts used, and the way transferFrom is implemented.
