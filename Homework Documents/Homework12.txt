Homework 12
Audit 1
Imagine you have been given the following code to audit
Contract
https://github.com/ExtropyIO/ExpertSolidityBootcamp/blob/main/exercises/audit/DogCoinGame.sol

with the following note from the team
"DogCoinGame is a game where players are added to the contract via the
addPlayer function, they need to send 1 ETH to play.
Once 200 players have entered, the UI will be notified by the startPayout event,
and will pick 100 winners which will be added to the winners array, the UI will then
call the payout function to pay each of the winners.
The remaining balance will be kept as profit for the developers."
Write out the main points that you would include in an audit report.
