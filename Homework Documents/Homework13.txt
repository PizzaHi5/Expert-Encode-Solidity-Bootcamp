Auditing and Formal Methods
1. Audit for tokens
Go through the token checklist for this contract

-   Lot of information to glean here. I read thru many of the resource links to get
    an understanding of all the exploits out there and see for myself the rigorous
    auditing processes that are in place. No wonder auditing is such a huge push 
    right now in the industry! Tons of vulnerabilities and possible attack vectors.

2. Scribble
1. Try the exercise here

-   Installed the repo and ran the commands listed. Took a while to run on my pc.
    Says the completed analysis was successful and no issues were detected.
    I compared this ERC20 contract with solmates ERC20, they both behave the same
    however this one does the same logic more inefficiently and has a require
    statement. The version difference is the major issue. 0.6.0 is vulnerable to
    overflow and this method has no overflow checks.
