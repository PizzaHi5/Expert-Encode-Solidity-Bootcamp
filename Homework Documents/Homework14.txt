Homework 14
Solidity / Yul bitwise
1. What are the potential dangers when performing the following bitwise operations
1. Left shift
2. Right shift
-   Since there are no checks, its possible to overflow and underflow accordingly:
    left shift overflow, right shift underflow.

2. Bit Operations
Imagine you have a uint256 variable in storage named x
check if x starts with de or be
if x starts with 0xde multiply x by 4 
-   0xde = 222
if x starts with 0xbe divide x by 4
-   0xbe = 190

Write the code in
a. Solidity
b. Yul
Which one is most gas efficient ?
