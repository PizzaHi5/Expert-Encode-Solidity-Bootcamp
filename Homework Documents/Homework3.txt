Homework 3
. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM
-   256bit word is used for keccek256 bit hashes. 
    Advantages:
    - Used in cryptography (keccek256 / ECDSA) 
    - Increased security

    Disadvantages:
    - Lots of unused bits of memory
    - Adds complexity to contract design to optimize memory usage

2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between
Ethereum clients ?
-   Like in the Shanghai hack 2016, if enough clients disagree with the compiled contract,
    the functionality of a particular contract could pass one time and fail another depending
    on the compiling contracts. It would lead to inconsistencies and security issues. 

. Using Remix write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the
debugger step through the function and inspect the memory.
