Homework 3
. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM
-   256bit word is used for keccek256 bit hashes. 
    Advantages:
    - Used in cryptography (keccek256 / ECDSA) 
    - Increased security

    Disadvantages:
    - Lots of unused bits of memory
    - Adds complexity to contract design to optimize memory usage

2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between
Ethereum clients ?
-   Like in the Shanghai hack 2016, if enough clients disagree with the compiled contract,
    the functionality of a particular contract could pass one time and fail another depending
    on the compiling contracts. It would lead to inconsistencies and security issues. 

. Using Remix write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the
debugger step through the function and inspect the memory.
-   I deployed the 2_owner contract in default remix and started stepping thru the code. I 
    noticed that I needed to create an etherscan account to step thru the debugger since it
    seems to pull the abi from etherscan (even though I generate it?). Good to know console.log
    works and actually displays information in remix. Tons of JUMP, POP, PUSH, MLOAD, DUP
    Note: Thanks to logging in and supplying my newly created API key from etherscan, I was able
    to auto verify my contract! Got the green check mark immediately w/o having to go thru all
    the hassle like I did previously. GAINS!
