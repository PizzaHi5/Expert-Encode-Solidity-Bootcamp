Homework 4
Try out the Solidity Template or the Foundry Template
. Start a new project using the Solidity Template
-   For me, all of these homeworks are in a Foundry context already. I setup the repo
    this way initially. 

. Make a fork of mainnet from the command line (you may need to setup an Infura
or Alchemy account)
. Query the mainnet using the command line to retrieve a property such as latest
block number.
-   This homework is the same as homework17 in the base encode Solidity course. I 
    forked mainnet using Foundry at the time. I add:
    eth-rpc-url = "my URL"
    to the foundry.toml file. I added it to this project as well. I sub out the url
    with my Alchemy url when its runtime. 'forge test' will run using the provided 
    alchemy key. 
    To query the live blockchain from the command line, I ran 'cast block latest
    --rpx-url <my URL>' => This returned the current block from mainnet right now
    which included 53 transaction hashes in the transactions block. Its good to see
    that difficulty is 0, means we are in PoS.

Is this valid solidity ? (picture is in the pdf version)
-   Yes, this is valid. I am surprised that its valid but its valid. I even tested
    some other cases and they are also valid. You can put functions as parameters
    into other functions.
