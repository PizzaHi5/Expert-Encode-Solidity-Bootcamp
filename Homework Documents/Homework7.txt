Homework 7
Functions
Question 1
Complete the following query function
    function query(bytes memory data, function(uint) external test)
    public {
    ...
    }
The query function should revert if the function type test passed is a standard
ERC20 transfer function.
-	transfer(0xa9059cbb), I am checking if test := this selector.

Question 2
The following function checks a function call passed in the data parameter.
    function checkCall(bytes calldata data) external{
    }

The data parameter is bytes encoded representing the following
    Function selector
    Target address
    Amount (uint256)
Complete the function body.

The function should revert if the function is not an ERC20 transfer function.
Otherwise extract the address and amount from the data variable and emit an event
with those details
-   event transferOccurred(address,uint256);
    Look at src and test contracts for how I did this homework. Ran into trouble
    at multiple points, especially during testing.
