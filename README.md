# Highlights

I am glad I learned a ton about the inner workings of Solidity and programming in Yul. The more I learned, the less I knew :) ! Writing basic mnemonics helped figuring out Yul once I learned the syntax. Yul is much more efficient. The power of Yul really shines when I was figuring out how the highly optimized MEV sandwich bot operates. Thats an insanely efficient use case!

### Good Yul vs Solidity reference

# Getting Started

To see some of the tests I wrote/executed on various homeworks using ubuntu, download the repo.

```git clone https://github.com/PizzaHi5/Expert-Encode-Solidity-Bootcamp```

Set up your .env file to include your ETH_RPC_URL

Run tests to see outputs

```forge test -vv```
